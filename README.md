# Enhancing-feature-selection-with-GMSMFO

GMSMFO algorithm:

The GMSMFO algorithm is a robust solution for global optimization and intrusion detection, improving upon the Moth-Flame Optimization (MFO) method by incorporating a novel Gaussian mutation mechanism and optimizing the exploration-exploitation trade-off. In extensive testing against the CEC 2017 benchmark and a variety of datasets, including high-dimensional and intrusion detection data, GMSMFO consistently outperforms cutting-edge meta-heuristics, while also demonstrating its ability to identify optimal feature subsets, enhancing classification accuracy and reducing feature usage. 

Instructions on compiling/running the programs:

Since the GMSMFO algorithm is implemented in Python, you won't need to compile it. To run the program, ensure you have Python installed on your system, which can be obtained from the official website. Then, obtain the GMSMFO Python script and navigate to its directory using the terminal or command prompt. Run the program by executing the Python script with the 'python' command, like 'python GMSMFO.py'.
